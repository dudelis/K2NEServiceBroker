== ADO Helper

This Service Object contains several helper functions, which can be used for data conversion/transformation, that are returned from ADO.NET query.


=== Join method - main features:
* You can provide a delimiter, which should be used to delimit the functions
* ADO.NET query is a preferred way of extracting the data from SMO, because simply specifying SMO and Method name, a user cannot set custom filtering and sorting options
* The query always joins the first returned property/column of the DataTable, received from the ADO.NET query.
